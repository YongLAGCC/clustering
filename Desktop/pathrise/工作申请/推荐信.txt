I am writing this letter to recommend Caleb Zhou for the position of Linux software engineer at Ksplice Product Team. Caleb graduated from Boston University as a computer science background. I know him 3 years ago at a Boston Hackathon. however, he brought energy and dependability that made him crucial to our Team. In the Hackathon, Caleb was shown with finding software solutions, and implementing workflow processes by assessing operational capability, troubleshooting and diagnostics, designing and calibrating system specifications, analyzing our team coding processes.  During that hackathon, he did an excellent job of managing and improving our team consistently. Caleb also did an excellent job staying up to date on software developments and thus finding new solutions. He had the most extensive and diverse knowledge of software at our company, and others even sought him out for advice. A reliable and highly capable employee, I canâ€™t recommend him highly enough.
Regards,
Frank Chen
