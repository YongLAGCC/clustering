Hi Ramya, 

My name is Caleb Zhou. I am a software engineer who recently graduated from Boston University.  I am very interested in contributing to PayPal's product as a general Software Engineer and wanted to send a note to express my interest directly. 

It's important to me to contribute to __ __company's ___ deep mission that can make a positive change in someone's life. I understand you also need quality matching candidates, so I thought I would tell you a bit about my technical background. I recently completed multiple internships and projects to improve my real-world programming skills in Java, JavaScript, Python, C++. For example, I have worked on Full Stack projects in Node.js to help a real-state agency to create websites and gained 4 million in total growth per year. 

I'd be honored to be considered for the team of university graduate -- with my programming skills and my passion for PayPal's mission, I know I can make an immediate impact on any team. Please let me know if you have some time to connect this week to discuss this opportunity. 

Best Regards, 
Caleb, Zhou
