My name is Caleb Zhou. I am a software engineer who recently graduated from Boston University. Apologies if you are not the right person to reach out to, but I am very interested in contributing to PayPal's product and wanted to send a note to directly express my interest.  

I applied to software engineer on PayPal's job page because I am attracted to PayPal's value of collaboration, innovation, wellness, inclusion, it's important to me to contribute to a deep mission that can make a positive change in someone's life. 

I wanted to tell you a little about myself. I recently completed some internships and projects to improve my real-world programming skills in Java, JavaScript, Python, C++. For example, I have worked on Full Stack projects in Node.js to help real state agency to create websites and gained 4 million in total growth per year. 

I'd be honored to be considered for the team of university graduate -- with my programming skills and my passion for PayPal's mission, I know I can make an immediate impact on any team. Please let me know if you have some time to connect this week to speak more about this opportunity. 


失败后， 成功的一次例子。


I was not satisfied with one of my midterm scores as a first-year college student. The exam has 100 questions; however, I only finished 80 problems with the correct rate of 80%. I was over detail-oriented. I realized that I should not check the answer immediately after I answered each question, but I finished all the questions and went back to check the correctness.  In this way, I did 100% correct in the final.
